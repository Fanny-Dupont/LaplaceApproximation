# LaplaceApproximation
Summary and extension of the paper written by Koyama et al. for my STAT 548 project.
In the .pdf file, we summarize the paper "Approximate Methods for State-Space Models" about the Laplace approximation in SSMs and provide a possible extension to it. We write the procedure in a more generalizable format in the Laplace_Approximation.R file and test it with the movement data of a polar bear. The procedure and results are available in .pdf file in the "Project" section. The data are available online.
The ARGOS data are available here: https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/624196
The GPS data are available here https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/624195
You will need it to run the .R code
